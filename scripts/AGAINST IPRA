To whom it may concern,

As a Canadian citizen, I am very concerned about the telecom Bell and its campaign to create a blacklist of websites to provide access to. Their proposed agency, the Internet Piracy Review Agency (IPRA), would directly infringe upon the open internet access afforded to Canadians. One of the major concerns with this issue is the ambiguity of the proposal - sites that are not designed for piracy, but can be hosts of it due to broad domain control, connections, or independant users, can be targeted and shut down, crippling major sections of the web. This could very easily be used by telecoms to wipe out competitors, or even accidentally blacklist benign sites without proper oversight. When power is put into the hands of corporations, any information that is disagreed with can be hindered. Supporting this proposition means holding corporate interests and control to a higher regard than citizen freedom, and damaging innocent websites that happen to be misused. Please aid in putting pressure on Trudeau and his administration to not allow this disregard for freedom and open access to one of this centuryâ€™s most important platforms - the internet.
