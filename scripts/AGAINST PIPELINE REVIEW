To whom it may concern,

As a Canadian citizen, I am very concerned about Bill C-69 and its proposed changes to the oil pipeline review process. Hindering the progress on pipelines will ultimately cost jobs and money to Canadians, as oil is a massive domestic source of income. Tying energy projects up in bureaucratic red tape only serves to lose money for the country, and especially its provinces that have economies deeply invested in oil. Oil corporations have been doing this for years, they are competent enough to implement pipelines safely. Activists are not experts, and have no place deciding important economic issues. Pipelines are also a safer way to transport oil than by train. Please do not fall victim to fear-mongering, and prevent the government from further delaying energy projects.

Signed,
