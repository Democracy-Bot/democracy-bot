To whom it may concern,
	
As a Canadian citizen, I am writing to express my approval of the proposed Bill C-69 in its changes to the oil pipeline review process. Oil pipelines can present a great risk to the environment, so enforcing stricter standards for approval - especially those that allow input from the community - is a commendable goal. Allowing oil companies to rush into their projects, while tempting, can damage the livelihood of Canada in the future. Given Trudeauâ€™s campaign commitment to improving relations with Indigenous communities and aiding in their rights, requiring pipeline proposals to be viewed by Indigenous panels is an excellent step in maintaining that promise. If this law were to not be backed, it would be a great blow to Indigenous communities and their trust in the current government. All in all, regulation is essential in such risky and large-scale projects, and this bill will aid in the process of enforcing that regulation. I urge you to defend it.

Signed,
