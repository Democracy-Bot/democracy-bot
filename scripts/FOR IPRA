To whom it may concern,

As a Canadian citizen, I would like to extend my support to the proposed Internet Piracy Review Agency (IPRA) and its goals. Piracy is a massive drain on corporations, especially small companies. Ensuring that copyright law is held up and piracy is prevented should be a priority of the forces that regulate the Canadian internet. A website blacklist would be a simple way to keep websites akin to the old Pirate Bay inaccessible, and thus having Canadians legally purchase their media. Piracy is theft, and like one would lock their safe or their home, we must prevent said theft from occuring. It is not a matter of freedom, it is a matter of letting companies, artists, and project designers keep their hard-earned money, and preventing websites from enabling crime. This is a need that must be addressed.
