        <p>In Canada, our government makes big decisions all the time. However, despite being a democracy, citizens are often powerless when it comes to having a say in these decisions and laws.</p>
        <p>Contacting your local representative can be a messy business, with many hoops to jump through. Democracybot seeks to change this.</p>
        <p>By connecting you to your representatives through a simple Facebook Messenger chat, Democracybot cuts out the confusion governments enable and lets you have a say. Pick a cause, enter your location, and Democracybot will find your representative and send them a message stating your position.</p>
        <p>Programs like this already exist in the United States, so don’t let Canada fall behind - participate in the government, and help enable democracy. What you have to say matters, and we’ll amplify your voice.</p>

            <h3>IPRA</h3>
            <p>
                Bell, along with other companies, is proposing the creation of an Internet Piracy Review Agency (IPRA) to look find websites that promote or enable piracy, and to put them on a blacklist that telecoms can use to block access to said sites.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Pros:</b> Crack down on piracy in Canada, block access to illegal sites
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Cons:</b> Infringes upon internet freedom, is unclear and may block benign sites, too much power for corporations
            </p>

            <h3>Pipeline Review</h3>
            <p>
                Bill C-69 proposes a more thorough approval process for oil pipelines through an Impact Assessment Agency, which would consult with Indigenous communities and environmental groups to approve and regulate these projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Pros:</b> Improving relations with Indigenous communities, ensuring safer oil transfer, reducing environmental impact
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Cons:</b> Loses money for oil companies by making it harder to approve their projects, allowing non-professionals and interest groups to weigh in
            </p>
